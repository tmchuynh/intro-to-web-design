- **Hierarchy**: Establish a clear visual hierarchy by using variations in size, color, and placement. Use larger fonts for headings and smaller fonts for body text to create a clear distinction between different levels of information. Use color and contrast to highlight important elements, such as call-to-action buttons or key messages. By creating a visual hierarchy, you can guide users through the design and help them understand the importance of different elements.
