      setScrollPosition(window.pageYOffset);
    };

    window.addEventListener("scroll", handleScroll);
    return () => window.removeEventListener("scroll", handleScroll);
  }, []);

  return (
    <div className="parallax-container">
      <div
        className="parallax-background"
        style={{
          transform: `translateY(${scrollPosition * 0.5}px)`,
          backgroundImage: 'url("/mountains.jpg")',
        }}
      />
      <div
        className="parallax-midground"
        style={{
          transform: `translateY(${scrollPosition * 0.3}px)`,
          backgroundImage: 'url("/trees.png")',
        }}
      />
      <div
        className="parallax-foreground"
        style={{
